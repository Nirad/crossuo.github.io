      <description>OrionUO is an Open Source Ultima Online&amp;reg; client, written from scratch for Windows by Hotride and ported to Linux and MacOSX by fungos. The project is currently maintained by fungos and Deuce.
The project aims to have a fully open Ultima Online&amp;reg; client compatible with different eras from the game.
The Orion Suite is composed of the game client, the game launcher and updater and (for the foreseeable future) a closed source scriptable game assistant similar to Razor Assitant.</description>

      <description>RELEASE NOTES
2019-01-19 Finally we&#39;re here! This release marks the first Orion release with real native multiplatform support, but more than anything, this marks the first time since Ultima Online launch that we have a functional native client for Linux and MacOSX. To get here, we invested a lot of time and did a lot of changes to the codebase that did not reflect in actual bug fixes, as this was much required so we will be able to continue going forward bringing life back to the project since it was abandoned.</description>
