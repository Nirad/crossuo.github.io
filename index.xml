      <description>OrionUO is an Open Source Ultima Online&amp;reg; client, written from scratch for Windows by Hotride and ported to Linux and MacOSX by fungos. The project is currently maintained by fungos and Deuce.
The project aims to have a fully open Ultima Online&amp;reg; client compatible with different eras from the game.
The Orion Suite is composed of the game client, the game launcher and updater and (for the foreseeable future) a closed source scriptable game assistant similar to Razor Assitant.</description>
